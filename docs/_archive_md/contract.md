# Universal Contract - Rules for All Projects

## Decision-Making Protocol

### ✅ DO Ask When Ambiguous
Present 2-3 options with trade-offs, then wait for explicit choice.

### ❌ DON'T Add Features Not Requested
If you think something would be useful, ASK first.

## Breaking Changes Protocol

### ✅ DO Explain Before Changing Architecture
Explain what you're changing, why, and any trade-offs.

### ❌ DON'T Silently Refactor
Never restructure without explanation.

## Completion Criteria

Before saying "Done" - check ALL:
- [ ] Tested at 375px, 768px, 1024px
- [ ] Zero console errors
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] No 'any' types in TypeScript
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 48px

## Communication Style

### ✅ DO Explain Concepts
- Define technical terms immediately
- Use concrete examples from current project
- Show WHY before HOW

### ❌ DON'T Use Abstract Analogies
Show actual code/data transformations instead.

## Scope Management

### Follow the 6-Day ROI Rule
Time to Build ÷ Time Saved Per Day = Days to Break Even

If break-even > 6 days, only build if pain is HIGH or explicitly requested.
