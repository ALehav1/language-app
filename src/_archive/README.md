# Archive Directory

This directory contains deprecated code that is no longer used in the active application but is preserved for historical reference.

## Archived Files

### January 8, 2026 - Foundation Milestone Cleanup

**Components:**
- `deprecated_components/SavedVocabularyView.tsx` - Old vocabulary view component, replaced by unified MyVocabularyView with filtering

**Utilities:**
- Test utilities were not found in the codebase (may have been previously removed)

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These files contain working code that may be useful for:
- Understanding historical implementation approaches
- Recovering specific logic if needed
- Reference for future similar features

## Safety Note

DO NOT import these files into active code. They are not maintained and may have outdated dependencies or patterns.
